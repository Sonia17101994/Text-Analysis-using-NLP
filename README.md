**Text Analysis using NLP**

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform comprehensive text analysis. The analysis covers a variety of metrics including sentiment analysis, readability, word count, syllable count, personal pronouns, and more.

**Sentimental Analysis**

Sentimental analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of text is positive, negative, or neutral. This project is specifically designed to analyze financial texts. The process involves:

**Cleaning using Stop Words Lists**

The text is cleaned using predefined Stop Words Lists to remove irrelevant words, ensuring accurate sentiment analysis.

**Creating a Dictionary of Positive and Negative Words**

A master dictionary is used to create lists of positive and negative words. Words from the Stop Words Lists are excluded from this dictionary.

**Extracting Derived Variables**

Positive Score: Calculated by assigning a +1 value for each word found in the Positive Dictionary.
Negative Score: Calculated by assigning a -1 value for each word found in the Negative Dictionary. The score is multiplied by -1 to ensure it's positive.
Polarity Score: Determines if the text is positive or negative using the formula:
Polarity Score = (Positive Score â€“ Negative Score) / (Positive Score + Negative Score + 0.000001)
Range: -1 to +1.
Subjectivity Score: Determines if the text is objective or subjective using the formula:
Subjectivity Score = (Positive Score + Negative Score) / (Total Words after cleaning + 0.000001)
Range: 0 to +1.
Readability Analysis
Readability is assessed using the Gunning Fog Index, which is calculated as:
Fog Index = 0.4 * (Average Sentence Length + Percentage of Complex Words)

Additional Metrics

**Average Number of Words Per Sentence**

Complex Word Count: Words with more than two syllables.
Word Count: Total cleaned words after removing stop words and punctuations.
Syllable Count Per Word: Number of syllables per word, with exceptions like words ending in "es" or "ed."
Personal Pronouns: Count of personal pronouns using regex, excluding terms like "US" referring to the country.
Average Word Length: Sum of characters per word divided by the total number of words.

This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing textual data, especially in the financial domain, by leveraging NLP techniques.
